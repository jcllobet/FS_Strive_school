You are building the frontend for an online shopping business. In particular, you are responsible for the back-office, where admins can add and edit products.

Today's task is to build a system to add new products.

Here is the API: https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/product/

Here is the product model:

```
{
  "_id": "5d318e1a8541744830bef139", //SERVER GENERATED

###Â ðŸ”´PROBLEM SOLVING CENTER / FAQ:
Learning how to read errors is very important! âœ¨

-   I am getting an empty array, why?

The API send you only the products YOU add. Try to POST something.

-   I am getting a 500 error, is something wrong with the server?

Probably not, check the preview of your response in the network tab. The response will give you the answer you are looking for.

Usually:

-   You are missing a field in your body
-   You have a "duplicate key", which means something with that name already exists
-   You sent the wrong type of data (eg. a string instead of a number on the price property)
